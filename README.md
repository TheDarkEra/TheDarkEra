# TheDarkEra
Ever wanted to go to The Dark Era? Now you can with our new mod TheDarkEra, TDE. The mod adds new Mobs, Blocks, Items, Tools, Weapons, Forges/Anvils, villages, dungeons and even a new Dimension. To keep the game more enjoyable the dragons and other boss like mobs will only spawn in The Dark Dimension. To get to the dimension you will need to find a Dark Portal located in the new villages.
